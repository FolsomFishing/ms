						<img class="img-left" src="images/tom.jpg" alt="Tom Leogrande" width="91" height="132" />As early as I can remember I have always loved to fish. It all began with my grandmother and grandfather taking me trout fishing to the high sierra mountains, where I fished all the daylight hours and sometimes more. Until only the past few years fishing was just a recreational activity for me which I did only in my leisure time. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.outdoorproshop.com/">Visit Out Door Pro Shop Online</a>
